# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

This E-Commerce backend project has encompassed many tools utilizing javascript, Insomnia, MySQL, routes, models, env files, and multiple npm installation items. It was created to take simple inputs, destorys, updates and creations into a database using Insomnia. It was a great challenege when creating it. Although a lot of the models and routes can be reptitive and boilerplate. Repitition is a priority when developing these applications. It allows users to continously update there products, categoroies, and tags to allow their possible small business to say up to date on stock.
